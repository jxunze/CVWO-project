# CVWO_project

###### Author: Jin Xunze (A0255453A)

This is a project I did up for NUS's CVWO project. It resembles a forum that users can log in, post and comment on other's posts.

It features CRUD functions and JWT authentication.

Tech stack:

- PostgreSQL as database
- Ruby on Rails as backend
- ReactJS as frontend

The backend is hosted on https://cvwo-project.onrender.com/ and frontend is hosted on https://main--dreamy-dodol-f0dd1c.netlify.app/.

See https://github.com/jxunze/CVWO-project-dockerised.git for dockerised version.
